# HackerInside EncryptionToolkit
[🇮🇹 Italian Version](README.md)

**HackerInside EncryptionToolkit** is software for encryption and digital signing based on the **CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax)** standard.
It supports **encryption, decryption, key management, and digital signature** with integration for **PKCS#11** devices.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Keystore Security**
>
> In the case of *PKCS#12 Keystores*, cryptographic keys are protected by two passwords:
>
> - a *master password* for the entire keystore
> - a *specific password* for the individual private key
>
> These passwords are the **only protection mechanism** in case the file is compromised.
> The software **cannot guarantee the security of the keys** if weak passwords are used.
>
> The keystore is protected with the following parameters:
`PBES2, PBKDF2, AES-256-CBC, Iteration 100000, PRF hmacWithSHA256`
>
> For *PKCS#11* devices, security depends on the device itself and the configured PIN.

## ⚙️ Main Features

> [!NOTE]
> **Compatibility**
>
> The software uses the **CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax)** standard.
> This ensures that data encrypted or signed with this application is compatible with other software conforming to the same standard (for example, **OpenSSL**).
>
> Future versions of the program will not compromise compatibility, since the CMS standard is not altered.
> Any incompatibilities may only arise from support for specific cryptographic algorithms.
>
> **Recommended configurations:**
>
> 🔒 *Maximum Security*
>
> - **Encryption:** `AES-256-GCM` or `ChaCha20-Poly1305`
> - **Hash:** `SHA-384` or `SHA-512`
> - **Asymmetric keys:** `NIST P-384` or `NIST P-512`
>
> 🔄 *Greater Compatibility*
>
> - **Encryption:** `AES-128-CBC` or `AES-256-CBC`
> - **Hash:** `SHA-256`
> - **Asymmetric keys:** `RSA-3072` or `RSA-8192`
